Description: The AgreeClust package considers a latent class
    regression modeling framework for highlighting the structure of
    disagreement among panels of raters involved in an inquiry. On the
    contrary to popular approaches, the present method considers the
    ratings data provided by all raters when studying the structure of
    disagreement among the panel. More precisely, the structure of
    disagreement is captured through the profiles of residuals of a
    no-latent class regression model adjusted on the entire set of binary
    ratings, and can be visualized by using exploratory data analysis
    tools. The disagreement between two raters is then quantify in a
    concise way through the Euclidean distance between their respective
    profiles of residuals, this disagreement index being used as a basis
    to construct a dendrogram representing the structure of disagreement
    among the panel. The proper number of disagreed clusters among the
    panel of raters is then chosen by implementing a sequential strategy
    to test the significance of each K-clusters structure of disagreement.
